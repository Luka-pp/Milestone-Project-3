# Moto Club Eire

For my **Milestone Project 3** on **Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development** course I have created a motorcycle club
application. MC Eire is a new motorcycle club where users can share their bikes, gear, and the favorite routes.

Design has been focused to fit all screen sizes.

## Who is this application for?
This web application is designed for all the motorcycle enthusiasts. They can share their motorcycle and also 
view the motorcycles of the other club members. Users can have multiple bikes added. As well as Motorcycles application also allows 
users to add all of their safety gear and their favorite route.
