## UX 5 Planes

### Strategy Plane

Goal was to create a social website for motorcycle enthusiasts who can share their bike and gear with other enthusiasts.
Users who register are able to add their motorcycle and post comments under all the other bikes.
I also wanted to make all added motorcycle visible for everyone who is maybe thinking of joining the club, because
every motorcycle enthusiast likes to see a nice bike.

### Scope Plane
To achieve user and ownerâ€™s goals, below are the minimum features to be included in this project. Also, **CRUD** &#40;Create, Read, Update, and Delete&#41; functions are required for this project so these are implemented as a part of essential features.

* Simple design landing page with call-to-action buttons
* Members page where users can see all the motorcycles with little details
* Call-to-action buttons on each motorcycle that shows more details about that motorcycle
* Register page where users can create an account to create account
* Login page where users can log in to the website
* Logout function that users can log out the website
* Profile page where users can see all their motorcycles and buttons to edit or delete any of them
* Add bike page where users can add their bikes
* Search on a members page so users can search through all the bikes
* Comments section under each motorcycle so users can interact
* 404 page that shows for invalid URL and takes users back to *Home* page safely

### Structure Plane

#### Header and navigation
Header is the same through entire website and consists of:
* Logo which on click redirects user to the home page
* Navigation links for *Home*, *Members*, *Log In* and register for users which are not logged in
* Navigation links for logged-in users: *Home*, *Members*, *Profile*, *Add Bike* and *Log Out*


Mobile Navigation is done with Materialize sidebar which is compressed into *burger* icon

#### Landing Page

Page consists of two static images with parallax styling and two call-to-action buttons with pulsating effect.
*Our Members* button redirects users to the *Members* page and *Join The Club* button redirects user to the *Register* page.

#### Members Page

Page features all the bikes entered by the users in the style of cards. 
Each card consists of the motorcycle image, Motorcycle nickname in the bottom left corner of the image, Make and Model 
of the motorcycle and information of its owner.
Each card also contains a call-to-action button with tooltip *Click for more!* which redirects user to the full details of that Motorcycle

At the bottom of the page there is pagination for user to brows through motorcycles collection.

#### Profile Page

This page consists of the header which displays the username of the user and information about all motorcycles he added.
Each motorcycle user adds is displayed in a card style as follows:
* Image
* Nickname in the bottom left corner of the image
* If user is looking at his profile the buttons for *Edit* and *Delete* will be shown
* Motorcycle make and model on the left side and details about the gear owner is using on the right side
* information of the users favorite route in format *Start of Route*, *Route Via*, *End of Route*.
* Comments of all users displayed in rows with the name of the user who posted the comment underneath
* If user is logged in: Text input field to add a comment accompanied by the button to post the comment


If the user has more motorcycles added the next motorcycle will be shown underneath in a new card with the same formatting as above

#### Add Bike Page

This page is only visible to the users who have registered. 

It consists of the form spreading through the whole screen. The form takes text input about his motorcycle, gear and favorite route
At the bottom of the page is the **Submit button which saves all the details in the database.
Note that the use needs to provide the image of the motorcycle in URL format as instructed by the Code Institute

Both pages just underneath the submit button have links for one other to help user with navigation.
