# Moto Club Eire

For my **Milestone Project 3** on **Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development** course I have created a
motorcycle club application. MC Eire is a new motorcycle club where users can share their bikes, gear, and the favorite
routes.

For link to the website click [Here](https://moto-club-eire.herokuapp.com/)

Application is designed for all screen sizes.

## Who is this application for?

This web application is designed for all the motorcycle enthusiasts. It showcases the

## What does it do?

Users can share their motorcycle and also view the motorcycles of the other club members. Users can have multiple bikes
added. As well as motorcycles, application also allows users to add all of their safety gear and their favorite route.
Users are also able to post comment under each of the bikes.

## User Experience

### User Stories

1. As a user I want to be able to navigate the website clearly and logically
2. As a user I want to be able to see all the bikes in the club
3. As a user I want to be able to register in the club, and s returning user i want to be able to log into my account
4. As a user I want to add my bike and gear to my profile
5. As a user I want to be able to see my profile and edit or delete my motorcycles
6. As a user I want to be able to post a comment under any bike
7. As a user I want to be able to search for the bikes in the club

### Fulfilment of user stories

1. Website is designed in such a way that is easy for user to navigate from page to page. Header and Footer are the same
   throughout the whole website so user is familiar with the layout and can always get to the desired place quickly and
   easily


2. When a user clicks on the Members page on the navigation button or on the **See Our Members** call-to-action button
   on the landing page, user is directed to the **Members** page. Members page displays all the Bikes from the
   registered user along with the **Find Out More** button on each motorcycle. Layout of the page is made in away that
   image of the motorcycle is taking most of the user's attention with basic details about make and model of the
   motorcycle


3. Clicking on the **Register** page in the navigation bar or on the **Join the Club** call-to-action button on landing
   page user is directed to the registration page. This page features very simple but effective form. User chooses
   his/hers username and password which will on the click on submit button create an account and direct user to his/hers
   profile. **Log In** link on the navigation bar directs user to the login page which when user fills in with his
   details logs user back in and directs him/her to the profile page.


4. After registering user will be shown an option in the navigation bar for adding his/hers motorcycle and the gear. **
   Add Bike** page features large contact form where user inputs all of his/hers gear and details of the motorcycle
   followed by the favorite route.


5. When user registers or logs in he/she is then directed to the profile page. Profile page displays all motorcycles
   that user has added. On each motorcycle there are 2 buttons one for *delete* and one for *edit* motorcycle. Delete
   button directs user to the **Delete** page where user needs to confirm the deletion of that motorcycle. **Edit**
   button directs user to prefilled form of that motorcycle where changes can be made and saved.


6. Together with all te details about the motorcycle and gear under eac one there is section for the comments. Comments
   can be added only by the registered users but can be viewed by everyone. Each comment features the comment, and the
   username of the person who posted it.


7. Members page which features all the motorcycles, and their basic details also contains a search function. When user
   fills in his/hers query user will be directed to a page where all the relevant results will be displayed.

## UX 5 Planes

### Strategy Plane

Goal was to create a social website for motorcycle enthusiasts who can share their bike and gear with other enthusiasts.
Users who register are able to add their motorcycle and post comments under all the other bikes. I also wanted to make
all added motorcycle visible for everyone who is maybe thinking of joining the club, because every motorcycle enthusiast
likes to see a nice bike.

### Scope Plane

To achieve user and ownerâ€™s goals, below are the minimum features to be included in this project. Also, **CRUD**
&#40;Create, Read, Update, and Delete&#41; functions are required for this project so these are implemented as a part of
essential features.

* Simple design landing page with call-to-action buttons
* Members page where users can see all the motorcycles with little details
* Call-to-action buttons on each motorcycle that shows more details about that motorcycle
* Register page where users can create an account to create account
* Login page where users can log in to the website
* Logout function that users can log out the website
* Profile page where users can see all their motorcycles and buttons to edit or delete any of them
* Add bike page where users can add their bikes
* Search on a members page so users can search through all the bikes
* Comments section under each motorcycle so users can interact
* 404 page that shows for invalid URL and takes users back to *Home* page safely

### Structure Plane

#### Header and navigation

Header is the same through entire website and consists of:

* Logo which on click redirects user to the home page
* Navigation links for *Home*, *Members*, *Log In* and register for users which are not logged in
* Navigation links for logged-in users: *Home*, *Members*, *Profile*, *Add Bike* and *Log Out*

Mobile Navigation is done with Materialize sidebar which is compressed into *burger* icon

#### Landing Page

Page consists of two static images with parallax styling and two call-to-action buttons with pulsating effect.
*Our Members* button redirects users to the *Members* page and *Join The Club* button redirects user to the *Register*
page.

#### Members Page

Page features all the bikes entered by the users in the style of cards. Each card consists of the motorcycle image,
Motorcycle nickname in the bottom left corner of the image, Make and Model of the motorcycle and information of its
owner. Each card also contains a call-to-action button with tooltip *Click for more!* which redirects user to the full
details of that Motorcycle

At the bottom of the page there is pagination for user to brows through motorcycles collection.

#### Profile Page

This page consists of the header which displays the username of the user and information about all motorcycles he added.
Each motorcycle user adds is displayed in a card style as follows:

* Image
* Nickname in the bottom left corner of the image
* If user is looking at his profile the buttons for *Edit* and *Delete* will be shown
* Motorcycle make and model on the left side and details about the gear owner is using on the right side
* information of the users favorite route in format *Start of Route*, *Route Via*, *End of Route*.
* Comments of all users displayed in rows with the name of the user who posted the comment underneath
* If user is logged in: Text input field to add a comment accompanied by the button to post the comment

If the user has more motorcycles added the next motorcycle will be shown underneath in a new card with the same
formatting as above

#### Add Bike Page

This page is only visible to the users who have registered.

It consists of the form spreading through the whole screen. The form takes text input about his motorcycle, gear and
favorite route At the bottom of the page is the **Submit button which saves all the details in the database. Note that
the use needs to provide the image of the motorcycle in URL format as instructed by the Code Institute

#### Login/ Register Pages

* *Login*
  This page consists of the simple contact form asking user for his/hers username and password to log him/her in the
  website

* *Register*
  This page is only visible to the users who are not logged in. Consists of simple contact form asking user to create a
  new account.

Both pages just underneath the submit button have links for one other to help user with navigation.

## Testing

Testing has been done and documented
in [Testing.md](https://github.com/Luka-pp/Milestone-Project-3/blob/master/Testing.md)

## Version Control

### Git & GitHub

I used **[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)** as a local repository and IDE
and **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** as a remote repository. The process of version control was:

* First I created a new repository on GitHub
* I have then connected my GitHub account and my PyCharm IDE
* I have then opened that repository in PyCharm and started coding
* In PyCharm I have created all the pages and folders
* I was then saving my work and pushing it to GitHub repository to keep it safe
* Process for saving, committing and pushing it to remote repository goes as follows:
* In the main window of PyCharm click on **Git**
* On drop down menu click on **Commit**
* The commit interface will open on the left side and after adding the commit message click on commit in the left bottom
  corner
* Work is now committed to the master branch
* To push that commit to the **GitHub** I clicked on **Commit and Push** button in the same window
* On click on **Commit and Push** button the pop up window will show where I needed to confirm that I want to push the
  work to my GitHub repository

## Deployment

This project requires back-end technologies, so so for the deployment [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) was used. **
Heroku**
is a cloud platform where users can host their projects. This platform offers free service as well as the paid one. For
the purpose of this project free version was enough.

There are two ways to deploy a website on Heroku:

1. Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI)
2. Connecting to GitHub repository. Connecting to GitHub repository which is much easier and recommended by a Code
   Institute

Steps that needed to be taken before actual deployment to **Heroku**:

1. Creating **requirements.txt**
    - this file contains all the necessary dependencies so Heroku can have them ready for the project
2. Creating **procfile**
    - this file contains necessary details about the project so that heroku know what and where is he deploying and in
      which programming language

Deployment steps:

- Creating account on **Heroku**
- Creating new app by clicking on *New* and then *Create new app*
- Type in the unique name on the app and choose a region closest to us for deployment
- Navigate to *Deploy* section and connect to **GitHub**
- Before enabling automatic deploys, hidden variables such as IP address, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI and MONGO_DATABASE
  need to be recorded in Heroku
- **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars** and fill out necessary keys and values
- When all the hidden variables done, click **Enable Automatic Deploys** and click **Deploy Branch*
- Once app deploys the confirmation message will be shown

## Database

For this project to be fully functional the website requires a database. MongoDB has benn used for this project. After
creating the account on **MongoDB** I have created a new **Cluster** and within that cluster I have created 3 main
collections which will be used throughout the project.

1. **User** Collection

- used to store all usernames and encrypted passwords for the registered users

2. **Comments** Collection

- used to store all the comments that users are creating under motorcycles

3. **Bikes** Collection

- used to store all the details about users motorcycles and their gear
